// Decides fall / sit / stand from COCO keypoint geometry.
//
// This replaces a learned 3-class detector head. The reason is measured: the old
// yolov8n classifier scored 100% on clean fixtures but 76.7% once they were
// blurred, greyed, darkened, downscaled or cropped, and `sit` came out at
// precision 0.545 / recall 1.000 - it never missed a sit and labelled nearly
// half its non-sits as one. It had learned scene appearance (bench, floor,
// indoor room) rather than body configuration, so any degradation pushed it
// toward its most common training class.
//
// Geometry does not have that failure mode. The angle between a subject's
// shoulders and hips is the same whether the frame is sharp or blurred, colour
// or greyscale, 1408px or 320px wide. What varies is whether the *keypoints* can
// be found, and that job is done by a COCO-pretrained pose model trained on
// ~200k person instances with heavy augmentation - a far better-conditioned
// problem than 3-way posture classification from 8,340 images.
//
// Thresholds below are calibrated against measured fixture values, quoted inline
// so a future reader can see the margin rather than guess at it. They are not
// fitted to a large sample - see MODEL_CARD.md on the fixture set's size.

// Torso angle off vertical, in degrees, above which the subject reads as
// horizontal. Measured: upright fixtures sit at 1.6/1.7/14.0 deg, the two falls
// at 57.6 and 72.3. 50 leaves ~36 deg of margin below and ~8 deg above, and is
// deliberately nearer the falls: a person bending to pick something up passes
// through 40-60 deg, and the tracker's FALL_CONFIRM_MS=1200 sustain requirement -
// not this threshold - is what stops that registering as a fall.
const FALL_TORSO_ANGLE = 50;

// A person lying directly toward or away from the camera has a foreshortened
// torso, so the angle understates how horizontal they are. A wide box covers
// that case. Measured: the street fall's box aspect is 2.28, every upright
// fixture is between 0.30 and 0.84.
//
// This used to additionally require torsoAngle >= 30, which made the escape
// hatch unreachable in exactly the geometry it exists for - a body foreshortened
// along the view axis has a LOW torso angle by construction, so the two
// conditions worked against each other. Measured over the corpus (2026-08-12):
// 27 detections have aspect >= 1.5 and were not called fall; of the 18 that
// carry a ground-truth label, 18 are falls and none is a sit or a stand, in
// every torsoAngle band below 30. The angle condition cost recall and bought
// nothing measurable, so it is gone.
//
// Residual risk, stated because the corpus cannot rule it out: a standing person
// with arms fully outstretched can exceed 1.5 while upright. None appears in
// 9,331 detections, but the corpus is fall-heavy, so this is an argument from
// absence. The tracker's 1.2s sustain is what stops a single such frame alarming.
const FALL_ASPECT = 1.5;

// Below FALL_TORSO_ANGLE but above this, the torso is neither clearly upright
// nor clearly horizontal (bending, crouching, reaching down). We do not flip the
// class here - we keep the sit/stand answer and discount its confidence, letting
// the tracker's confidence-weighted vote settle it over its 7-frame window.
const AMBIGUOUS_TORSO_ANGLE = 30;

// Vertical hip-to-knee separation, normalised by torso length. Measured: seated
// on a bench -0.16 (knees above hips, legs drawn up), standing 0.74 to 0.83.
const STAND_KNEE_DROP = 0.5;

// Knees this far ABOVE the hips is not a seated posture - it is a body on its
// back, sprawled, or inverted. Without this the sit branch swallows them: a
// negative kneeDrop is trivially < STAND_KNEE_DROP, so `sit` was the answer for
// anyone lying down whose torso angle stayed under the fall gate.
//
// This is the same guard the squat gate already had. SQUAT_HIP_ANKLE_DROP_MIN
// was added because inverted bodies were leaking into `squat`, on the reasoning
// that "a fall relabelled `squat` is a missed alarm" - but the sit branch below
// never got the equivalent, so the leak simply moved from `squat` to `sit`.
//
// Placed at -0.25 rather than 0 deliberately: STAND_KNEE_DROP's own comment
// records a genuine bench-sit measured at -0.16, legs drawn up. A floor at 0
// would reclassify that real sit as a fall. -0.25 sits below it with margin.
//
// Measured over the corpus (2026-08-12), among detections predicted `sit`:
//   kneeDrop < -1.00   36 fall :  0 sit
//   -1.00 to -0.50    109 fall :  2 sit
//   -0.50 to -0.25    109 fall :  7 sit
// 254 recovered falls against 9 sits turned into false alarms, ~28:1. Read the
// `fall` label with the caveat MODEL_CARD gives it - the 2023 class marks
// "person is down", which includes seated-on-the-ground - but a person on the
// ground with knees above their hips is sprawled, and "down" is the alarm an
// anomaly detector should raise either way.
const INVERTED_KNEE_DROP = -0.25;

// Projected thigh length over projected shin length.
//
// The femur and tibia are within ~10% of each other in real length, so when
// both lie in the image plane - which is what standing with vertical legs
// means - their projected ratio is ~1. A thigh much shorter than its own shin
// can only mean the thigh points toward or away from the lens.
//
// This catches the case both other features are blind to: someone sitting
// facing the camera with their legs stretched out forward. Their knees sit
// well below their hips (kneeDrop 0.64, reads as standing) and their leg is
// nearly straight (kneeAngle 172deg, reads as standing), but the thigh is
// foreshortened to 0.58 of its shin, which no standing pose produces.
//
// The two mechanisms are complementary rather than redundant: a side-on sit
// has the thigh in-plane and horizontal, so kneeDrop and kneeAngle catch it
// while the ratio stays ~1; a front-on sit foreshortens the thigh, so only the
// ratio catches it. Measured - standing 1.00 / 1.01 / 1.07 / 1.08 / 1.11,
// front-on seated 0.47 / 0.58, side-on seated 1.38 (caught by the other two).
//
// Robust to camera pitch because it is a ratio of two adjacent segments: a
// high or low camera foreshortens thigh and shin together and cancels out.
const SIT_THIGH_FORESHORTEN = 0.75;

// The same ratio read from the other end. SIT_THIGH_FORESHORTEN catches a thigh
// short relative to its shin; this catches a *shin* short relative to its thigh,
// which means the shin points at the lens - the signature of kneeling or being
// down on all fours. It was an unused half of an existing signal: the rule below
// only ever tested the low side.
//
// Measured over 3,106 corpus detections, the separation is total: no `stand`
// reaches 1.81 and no `sit` reaches 1.64, while 40 of 1,382 `fall` boxes clear
// 2.5 (up to 12.3). 2.5 is therefore well clear of every upright posture rather
// than fitted to the falls.
//
// Emitting `fall` for this is a deliberate choice and the weakest link in the
// gate: kneeling is not falling. It is justified by where the cases came from -
// people on all fours immediately after going down, which the torso angle misses
// because their torso is still upright - and it is guarded downstream by
// tracker.js's 1.2s sustain, which a deliberate kneel outlives but a stumble
// does not. Three of 108 crouching-bystander boxes trip it; that is the measured
// false-alarm cost.

// carved out of what the rules below would otherwise call `sit`, and all three
// conditions must hold at once - each alone is far too broad.
//
// Measured medians across the corpus, which is what places these:
//
//            kneeAngle   hipAnkleDrop   stanceOffset
//   squat        95           0.75          0.21
//   sit         116           1.15          0.50
//   stand       175           1.47          0.08
//
// The ordering squat < sit < stand holds on both leg features, which is the
// whole basis for the class. Note `stand` also has a low stanceOffset - feet
// under hips is true of standing too - so that feature cannot gate alone; it is
// kneeAngle and hipAnkleDrop that exclude standing.
const SQUAT_KNEE_ANGLE = 130; // squat median 95, stand p10 155
const SQUAT_HIP_ANKLE_DROP = 1.0; // squat median 0.75, sit median 1.15
const SQUAT_STANCE_OFFSET = 0.5; // squat p75 0.36, fall median 0.81

// hipAnkleDrop also needs a *floor*, which is not symmetry for its own sake. The
// feature is signed: negative means the ankles sit above the hips, which is not
// a deep crouch but an inverted or sprawled body - someone on the ground with
// their legs up. Without this bound the gate accepted them, and a fall relabelled
// `squat` is a missed alarm rather than a cosmetic error.
//
// Found by running the gate over the corpus and reading the emitted reasons: a
// detection came back `knee 128deg, hips -2.36 over ankles`. Measured, 0.3 drops
// 42 such fall-to-squat leaks and costs 3 genuine crouches, and still sits below
// the squat class's own p10 of 0.41.

// --- the squat second opinion ---------------------------------------------
//
// Consulted at exactly two points below, both of which were about to return
// `sit` at tier A. It is the one learned component in this file, and its scope
// is deliberately the narrowest thing that was measured to work.
//
// The full four-class classifier this is carved out of was rejected on
// 2026-08-12: `squat` transferred across domains (recall 0.809 against these
// gates' 0.427) but `fall` collapsed, the model calling 61% of POLAR's
// non-fallen people a fall where the gates call 11.5%. Taking only the squat
// half, and only where the gates have already declined to raise an alarm, keeps
// the result that held and discards the one that did not.
//
// Three invariants, and they are structural rather than promised - they follow
// from *where* this is called, so no threshold or model change can break them:
//
//   1. It never runs on a row the fall gates claimed. Those return above. So it
//      cannot suppress an alarm.
//   2. It never runs on a row that would answer `stand`. Stand precision was
//      the criterion the full replacement failed.
//   3. Its only possible output is `squat` in place of `sit` - two non-alarming
//      classes. Its worst case is a cosmetic relabel.
//
// Measured on corpus-2023, a domain it never saw in training or in threshold
// selection: squat recall 0.427 -> 0.536, sit recall 0.542 -> 0.475, `fall` and
// `stand` bit-identical. 12 genuine squats recovered against 4 correct `sit`
// calls broken, an exchange rate of 3:1 that held at 3.5:1 on the held-out
// POLAR split. Compare the alternative of simply widening SQUAT_HIP_ANKLE_DROP,
// measured in MODEL_CARD.md at 4 gained per 7 broken - a losing trade.
//
// It relaxes the squat gate's CEILING; it does not replace the gate's
// definition. `stanceOffset` stays a hard precondition at the same
// SQUAT_STANCE_OFFSET the gate uses, so the probe can only ever fire on a body
// whose feet are under it. That is not caution for its own sake - it was found
// by posture-check.mjs, which caught the unguarded probe calling a canonical
// chair-sit (knees level with the hips, feet projected 0.88 torso-lengths
// forward) a squat at 0.57. Feet forward of the hips is the one signature that
// separates a chair-sit from a crouch, the gate already encodes it, and the
// probe does not reliably learn it from raw joints.
//
// Measured cost of the guard on corpus-2023: 12 recovered squats become 10, and
// the exchange rate improves from 3.00:1 to 3.33:1. So it is cheap, and it buys
// back the property that the geometry defines the class while the model only
// decides how far inside it to reach.
//
// Requiring stanceOffset to be non-null also enforces tier A structurally - the
// feature needs the ankle - rather than by the caller remembering to.
